# 👋 Hi, I'm Navya Polsani

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a dedicated and experienced Full Stack Java Developer with over 8 years of hands-on experience in user-friendly web applications. I enjoy working across the full stack — creating responsive user interfaces using React and Angular on the frontend, and developing powerful backend systems using Java and Spring Boot. I'm also skilled in integrating messaging systems like RabbitMQ and Kafka to support smooth communication between services. My work often involves designing and managing databases, both relational and NoSQL, to ensure data is handled efficiently. I have strong experience with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, and often deploy and manage applications in cloud environments. I take pride in writing clean code, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies to stay up to date in the fast-moving tech world.
